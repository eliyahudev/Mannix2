
Guidelines for hierarchical FPGA synthesis 
==========================================

General:

In case of changes at SOC/Core level a new hierarchical VQM instantiated at fpgnix_hir  is required

Currently available only for Enics system as Synplify is required to work around Quartus limitations

vqm_msystem_wrap.v level and below - compiled by Synplify generating a block box VQM
Above msystem meaning fpgnix and xbox - compiled by Quartus.


On Enics environment go to:
ddp23_pnx/src/ips/pulpenix/src/fpga

qrun ./vqm_run_msystem_synplify.sh

In case of failure check messages at : rev_1/synlog/report/vqm_msystem_wrap_compiler_errors.txt

Go to FPGA compilation windows environment (repo ddp23_fpgnix_win)
and proceed with guidelines at ddp23_fpgnix_win/README.md
